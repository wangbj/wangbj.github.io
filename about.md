  My name is Baojun Wang, I'm a system software engineer with 
  strong interests in functional programming. I love Haskell,
  though have been written more rust - another (lower level
  functional) programming language I really enjoyed.

  Programming is a major part of life, and trying to be a
  better developer everyday :)
